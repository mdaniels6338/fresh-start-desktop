# Fresh Start Desktop

*Keep the job list on disk before a new house.*

## About

This repository is **Fresh Start Desktop**, a desktop utility. Keep the job list on disk before a new house.

Cleaning-sim jobs hide under Steam IDs.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## Editions

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Highlights

- Finds the Fresh Start folder.
- Archives job and house files.
- Lists tidy photo albums.
- Writes a short keep report.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
